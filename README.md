# Soltaire Undo
Small project implementing undo function for drag-and-drop card table.

# Future possible improvenets
* Introduce DI for injecting dependencies.
* Introduce MVP or MVC architecture.
* Optimize project for reusing existing views.
* Add state machine to handle the game state.

# Usage of AI
* Used Copilot to fill the code during the development: fields, comments, generating empty classes etc.
* Used Copilot for implementing `UndoStack`. However, needed to rewrite it.
* Used ChatGPT for creating a drag-and-drop controller. Needed to rewrite it as well.
